      <ul>
        <li class="pricePoint"><strong>The Skill and Experience of the Artist</strong>: This is the main factor in determining the price a tattoo artist charges. A professional tattooist will charge more for his/her service. They usually charge by the hour but will charge for the price of the tattoo if it is a small one that can be done in one sitting. If they have tattooed for years but have no skill, or alternatively, they have skill but no experience, they won't be able to charge a premium price. An artist must possess both of these attributes to ask for the big bucks.</li>
        <li class="pricePoint"><strong>Complexity</strong>: A complex design with lots of intricate details will take multiple sessions and long hours. Watercolor tattoos, for example, cost a lot more than getting simple writing in black ink because they require a lot of color and skilled technique to create. Therefore, the amount of time it takes to get a tattoo will be a strong determining factor.</li>
        <li class="pricePoint"><strong>Color</strong>: The more colors there are, the longer it will take because multiple colors means that the design is somewhat more complicated. Watercolor tattoos can cost as much a $400 for a four-inch wide area.</li>
        <li class="pricePoint"><strong>Body Placement</strong>: Tattoo placement is also a big determining factor. Some artists charge  more for a tattoo on a challenging body area. Difficult locations include the neck, elbow, feet, and face. Hand or finger tattoos are relatively easier.</li>
        <li class="pricePoint"><strong>Custom Design</strong>: A simple flash design that the artist or tattoo parlor already has a stencil of will cost around $50 to $100. If the artist has to create an original design based on what you want, the time he/she takes to conceptualize and draw the piece will factor into the price.</li>
        <li class="pricePoint"><strong>Size</strong>: The smaller the tattoo, the cheaper it will be. A small tattoo on your wrist might bring you down 50 bucks, but a full back tattoo will cost an average of $2000 to $5000 and upwards.</li>
        <li class="pricePoint"><strong>Tattooing Tools</strong>: The tools and supplies used to create your tattoo are another expense incurred by the artist and passed onto you, the consumer. Such items include ink, needles, sterilization units, inkwells, lotions, wipes, and sprays.

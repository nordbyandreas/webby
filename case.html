                    A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring whi
                    ch I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
                    created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisit
                    e sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a si
                    ngle stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When,
                    while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface
                    of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary,
                    I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth,
                    a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stal

                    Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live
                    the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
                    language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary re

                    , wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her
                    seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the firs

                    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed in
                    to a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could se
                    e his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
                    able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared wi
                    th the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he tho
                    ught. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully b
                    etween its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa
                    was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an ill
                    ustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
                    fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards th
                    e viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops

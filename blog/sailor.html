        <h1 class="pageTitle">Sailor tattoos</h1>
        <p>Old-school sailor tattoos are rooted in the sailors interpretation of traditions and symbols that go back thousands of years. Every tattoo or ‘Flash’ is a personal statement but there are certain common meanings. Here are a few of our favorite Sailor Tattoo Meanings.</p>

          <h3>Swallow tattoos</h3>
          <p>In addition to indicating that a sailor had sailed 5000 miles, swallow tattoos are also associated with the idea of return. This "return" symbolism is rooted in two ideas. The first was the swallow's famous migration pattern, always returning home to San Juan Capistrano. Second, it was believed that if a sailor dies at sea, birds carry his soul home to heaven.</p>

          <h3>Anchor tattoos</h3>
          <p>At sea, the anchor is the most secure object in a sailor's life, making it the perfect representation of stability. This is why you'll often see anchor tattoos emblazoned with "Mom" or the name of a sailor's sweetheart (the people who keep them grounded). Anchors have become popular within general tattoo culture over the years, but the symbolism is still the same. It's a reminder of what keeps you steady.

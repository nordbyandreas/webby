        <p><b>Tattoos have been around</b> for ages. It has been proven that the pharaohs in Egypt and their queens even dawned tattoos. Through the years of tattoos there have been several trends started stopped and started up again. However, there seems to be a bit of a mystery to when and why the good old “Mom” tattoo began. <br><br>One tattoo artist said that he wasn’t quite sure how the popular trend really got started but was told a story by his mentor and how the “Mom” tattoo came to be.
<br><br>
The story that he was told goes something like this, an Irish sailor had gotten a tattoo after being exposed to the natives of New Zealand in or about the 19th century. The tattoo he got was a heart with a sabre in it with a banner that said “Mother”. The idea was from an Irish drinking song in which the singer says that he “saluted father dear and kissed me darling mother” before he left home for the first time to earn a living.

<br><br>Whether or not this tale is true remains to be seen. However, it is probably safe to say that some sailor or servicemen was the one to start this traditional type of tattoo as tattoo artist refer to them today.<br><br> You can see the traditional “Mom” tattoo on all sorts of people, but they are most popular with servicemen, bikers and men in general. But some woman have even been know to have a “Mom” tattoo of their own, but woman tend to go towards a less traditional way and come up with some sort of cute design with the word “Mom” or “Mommy” in it.</p>

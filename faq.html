 <strong class="q">Does getting a tatoo hurt?</strong>
 <p class="a">Yes, receiving a tattoo is a painful process. It requires the application of pigment under the first epidermal layer of the skin. The larger the tattoo the longer it will take to do, so small tattoos hurt less than the large ones! But remember, people wouldn't get a second tattoo if the first one hurt that bad. Don't be a sissy! </p>
 <strong class="q">How do I care for my new tattoo?</strong>
 <p class="a">
  Your tattoo has to be put under strict sanitary conditions.
  Keep it clean and follow these instructions:
  <ul class="a">
    <li>1. Leave bandage on for 5-6 hours</li>
    <li>2. Remove bandage, wash with warm water and soap, pat dry</li>
    <li>3. Never bandage again</li>
    <li>4. Before scab forms apply NEOSPORIN 3 or 4 times daily.</li>
    <li>5. Stay out of chlorine pools, salt water, and only minimum sun exposure while tattoo is healing</li>
  </ul>
  <strong class="q">What is the best time of year to get a tattoo?</strong>
  <p class="a">Although you can get a tattoo any time of the year, your skin gets a lot more abuse during the summer with swimming, tanning and just being exposed to the elements more. Winter time is really the best season to get a tattoo. For more details, see 'Tis the Season to be Tattooed.</p>
  <strong class="q">Is it OK to get a tattoo if I'm sick?</strong>
  <p class="a">Getting a tattoo when your immune system isn't at 100% isn't a good idea. You're going to need your strength and your white blood cells to heal your tattoo, something your body won't be able to do if it's already doing battle against virus and bacteria. Not to mention the fact that it's very inconsiderate to bring your illness into the tattoo studio and risk passing the germs onto others, particularly your artist.

If you have an appointment, call and reschedule for when you're feeling well again.</p>

<strong class="q">Can you fix my old tattoo?</strong>
<p class="a">Old tattoos can be easily reworked into a fresh work of art. Color can be added to brighten your existing tattoo or with a little creativity even turned into a completely new (although larger) tattoo. There's no use in going through life with "Susan" tattooed on your arm if you love "Pam." Thanks to the modern possibilities of the Tattoo Factory experience, it can all be corrected. Why wait? We fix other tattoo shop's mistakes every day!</p>
